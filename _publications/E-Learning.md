The study of effectiveness in e-learning is a challenging and
complex task for higher learning institutions. This study aims to
understand the factors influencing e-learning effectiveness in the
context of tertiary education in Afghanistan. For this purpose, an
empirical study was conducted to examine the effect of individual
barriers, technological barriers, organizational barriers, and elearning effectiveness. In general, several prior studies have
focused on the factors that influence e-learning effectiveness.
However, there is limited research that simultaneously captures and
explains the factors impacting e-learning effectiveness in higher
education institution in Afghanistan. This empirical study takes a
total of 384 students from four Afghanistan universities
participating in this study. Findings indicate that individual
barriers, technological barriers, and organizational barriers, each
had a significant impact on the effectiveness of e-learning. The
findings of this study can be useful for university leadership and
management, enhancing effectiveness in the e-learning
